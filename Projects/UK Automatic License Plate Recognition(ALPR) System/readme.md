# ALPR System for UK Cars

## Overview
This repository contains a Automatic License Plate Recognition (ALPR) system for cars in the United Kingdom. The system is capable of detecting and recognizing license plates from images and videos of vehicles. It utilizes a deep learning model for license plate detection and recognition.

## Contents

- `license_plate_model`: This folder contains the pre-trained deep learning model for license plate detection and recognition.
- `dataset`: The dataset used to train and evaluate the model can be found in this folder.
- `results`: This folder contains the output results of the ALPR system in both MP4 video format and a CSV file.

## Model Source

The model used in this project is based on the tutorial from the YouTube video: [ALPR Model Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyJB1t0o0ms).

## Dataset Source

The dataset used for training and evaluation can be found at the following Kaggle link: [Highway Car Video Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nilesh14k/highway-car-video).

## Example

An example image of a UK license plate can be found in this repository with the name `uk_license_plate_example`.

## Results

The results of the ALPR system, including the tracking ID, license plate text, and confidence score, can be found in the `results` folder.
