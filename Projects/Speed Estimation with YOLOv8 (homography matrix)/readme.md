This experiment is based on the article titled 'Vehicle Speed Estimation Using Computer Vision and Evolutionary Camera Calibration' authored by Hector Mejia, Esteban J. Palomo, Ezequiel LÃ³pez-Rubio, Israel Pineda, and Rigoberto Fonseca-Delgado.

The method uses YOLOv8 to detect vehicles on the street. After detection, it employs the Haversine distance formula to calculate the distance between the first vehicle's frame and the i-th vehicle's frame. The homography matrix is then used to map the real-world points of the vehicle to the corresponding points on the image.
