# Data Science and Computer Vision Portfolio

Welcome to my Data Science and Computer Vision Portfolio! Here you will find a collection of my projects and experiences related to the fields of Data Science and Computer Vision.

This repository contains a diverse range of projects that I have worked on, encompassing both Data Science and Computer Vision aspects. Some of the projects include:

- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** I have explored complex datasets, identifying patterns, trends, and hidden relationships to gain meaningful insights.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Utilizing machine learning algorithms and statistical techniques to build predictive models that can forecast future behaviors and support informed decision-making.
- **Data Visualization:** Creating interactive and intuitive visualizations to communicate complex information clearly and effectively.

In addition to traditional Data Science projects, I have also ventured into the domain of Computer Vision, where I have undertaken projects related to:

- **Automatic License Plate Recognition (ALPR):** Developing systems that can automatically detect and recognize license plates from images or video streams, aiding in various applications such as traffic enforcement, parking management, and toll collection.
- **Speed Estimation:** Building algorithms to estimate vehicle speeds from video data, which can be valuable for traffic monitoring and law enforcement purposes.

Throughout my projects, I have acquired a diverse set of skills in various areas, including:

- **Programming Languages:** Proficient in Python and R for Data Science tasks, as well as implementing Computer Vision algorithms.
- **Tools:** Utilizing Power BI for data visualization and relevant Computer Vision libraries and frameworks.
- **Libraries:** Experience with TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, OpenCV, and other essential libraries.
- **Statistical and Exploratory Data Analysis:** Gaining insights and understanding data patterns through rigorous analysis.
- **Modeling and Evaluation:** Building and evaluating machine learning and Computer Vision models to achieve high performance.
- **Data Visualization:** Effectively communicating complex information and findings through visual representations.

This portfolio showcases my passion for both Data Science and Computer Vision, and I am excited to share my work with you. If you have any questions or would like to collaborate on a project, feel free to reach out to me.

Thank you for visiting!
